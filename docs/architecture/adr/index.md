# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Hexabase.AI. ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during the development and evolution of the platform.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. Each ADR describes:

- **Context**: The situation and forces at play
- **Decision**: The change we're proposing or have agreed to implement
- **Consequences**: What happens after applying the decision

## ADR Status

ADRs can have the following statuses:
- **Proposed**: Under discussion
- **Accepted**: Approved and being implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer applicable
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR

## Current ADRs

## How to Use ADRs

### For Developers
1. **Before making architectural changes**: Check existing ADRs to understand current decisions
2. **When proposing changes**: Create a new ADR following the template
3. **During implementation**: Reference relevant ADRs in code comments and documentation

### For Architects
1. **Review proposed ADRs**: Evaluate new architectural decisions
2. **Update status**: Mark ADRs as accepted, deprecated, or superseded
3. **Ensure consistency**: Verify new decisions align with existing architecture

### For New Team Members
1. **Start here**: Read ADRs to understand key architectural decisions
2. **Ask questions**: Use ADRs as conversation starters about design choices
3. **Learn patterns**: Understand the reasoning behind our architecture

## Creating a New ADR

To propose a new architectural decision:

1. **Copy the template**: Use the template below as a starting point
2. **Number sequentially**: Use the next available ADR number
3. **Follow naming convention**: `adr-XXX-brief-description.md`
4. **Submit for review**: Create a pull request with your proposed ADR

### ADR Template Structure

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title

## Status
Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Superseded by ADR-YYY

## Context
What is the issue we're seeing that motivates this decision?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult after this change?
```

## ADR Principles

1. **Document significant decisions**: Not every decision needs an ADR
2. **Keep it concise**: ADRs should be brief but complete
3. **Focus on "why"**: Explain the reasoning, not just the outcome
4. **Immutable records**: Don't edit accepted ADRs; create new ones instead
5. **Link related ADRs**: Reference other relevant decisions

## Review Process

1. **Author creates**: Developer writes ADR following template
2. **Team reviews**: Architecture team evaluates proposal
3. **Discussion period**: Allow time for feedback and iteration
4. **Decision made**: Accept, reject, or request changes
5. **Status updated**: Mark ADR with final status
