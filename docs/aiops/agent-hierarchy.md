# AI Agent Hierarchy

The Hexabase.AI platform implements a sophisticated hierarchical agent system to provide intelligent automation and assistance across your Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Overview

The AIOps system uses a multi-layered agent architecture designed to efficiently manage tasks, provide intelligent responses, and automate complex operations while maintaining security and user permissions.

## Agent Hierarchy Structure

### 1. User-Facing Chat Agent
The top-level agent that interacts directly with users through the platform interface.

**Responsibilities:**
- Natural language understanding and response
- Request routing to appropriate specialized agents
- Context maintenance across conversations
- User permission verification

**Key Features:**
- Conversational interface for all platform operations
- Context-aware responses based on user's current workspace
- Multi-language support (English and Japanese)

### 2. Orchestrator Agent
The central coordination layer that manages task distribution and agent collaboration.

**Responsibilities:**
- Task decomposition and planning
- Agent selection and coordination
- Result aggregation and synthesis
- Error handling and recovery

**Key Features:**
- Intelligent routing based on task type
- Parallel task execution when possible
- Progress tracking and status updates

### 3. Specialized Worker Agents

#### Infrastructure Analysis Agent
- Monitors cluster health and performance
- Identifies optimization opportunities
- Provides capacity planning recommendations
- Detects anomalies and potential issues

#### Deployment Assistant Agent
- Guides users through application deployments
- Validates configurations before deployment
- Suggests best practices and optimizations
- Troubleshoots deployment issues

#### Cost Optimization Agent
- Analyzes resource utilization
- Identifies cost-saving opportunities
- Recommends right-sizing strategies
- Tracks spending trends

#### Security Compliance Agent
- Monitors security policies
- Identifies compliance violations
- Suggests remediation steps
- Maintains audit trails

#### Troubleshooting Agent
- Diagnoses application and infrastructure issues
- Provides step-by-step resolution guidance
- Accesses logs and metrics for analysis
- Suggests preventive measures

## Agent Communication Flow

## Security Model

All agents operate within the platform's security framework:

1. **Permission Inheritance**: Agents inherit user permissions through JWT tokens
2. **Action Authorization**: All actions are authorized by the Control Plane
3. **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all agent actions
4. **Sandboxed Execution**: Agents run in isolated environments

## Best Practices

### Effective Agent Interaction

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed requests for better results
2. **Use Context**: Reference specific resources or namespaces
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Build on previous responses for complex tasks

### Common Use Cases

- "Analyze the performance of my production cluster"
- "Help me deploy a new application with auto-scaling"
- "Find cost optimization opportunities in workspace 'dev'"
- "Troubleshoot why my pods are failing to start"

## Integration with Platform Features

The agent hierarchy integrates seamlessly with:

- **Observability Stack**: Access to metrics, logs, and traces
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Deployment automation and validation
- **RBAC System**: Permission-aware operations
- **Resource Management**: Cluster and application lifecycle

## Limitations and Considerations

- Agents operate within user permissions
- Complex operations may require multiple steps
- Real-time constraints for certain operations
- LLM model limitations for specialized domains

## Future Enhancements

The agent system is continuously evolving with planned improvements:

- Additional specialized agents for new use cases
- Enhanced collaboration between agents
- Improved learning from user interactions
- Extended automation capabilities
