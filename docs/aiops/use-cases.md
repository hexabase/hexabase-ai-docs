# AIOps Use Cases

Discover how Hexabase.AI's AIOps capabilities can transform your Kubernetes operations through real-world use cases and practical examples.

## Overview

AIOps in Hexabase.AI combines artificial intelligence with operations to automate complex tasks, provide intelligent insights, and enhance decision-making across your Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Use Case Categories

### 1. Intelligent Troubleshooting

#### Automated Root Cause Analysis

**Scenario**: Application experiencing intermittent failures in production

**How AIOps Helps**:
```
User: "My app is failing randomly in production"

AI Agent:
1. Analyzes application logs across all pods
2. Correlates with metrics (CPU, memory, network)
3. Identifies pattern: OOM kills during traffic spikes
4. Recommends: Increase memory limits and implement HPA

Resolution provided in < 2 minutes vs hours of manual debugging
```

#### Smart Log Analysis

**Scenario**: Searching through millions of log entries for errors

**Traditional Approach**:
- Manual grep commands
- Time-consuming pattern matching
- Easy to miss correlated events

**AIOps Approach**:
- Natural language queries: "Show me all database connection errors in the last hour"
- Automatic pattern recognition
- Correlation with deployment events

### 2. Proactive Performance Optimization

#### Resource Right-Sizing

**Scenario**: Over-provisioned resources leading to unnecessary costs

**AIOps Analysis**:
```yaml
Current State:
  CPU Request: 2000m
  CPU Usage (P95): 200m
  Memory Request: 4Gi
  Memory Usage (P95): 1.2Gi

AI Recommendation:
  CPU Request: 500m
  Memory Request: 2Gi
  Estimated Savings: $450/month
  Risk Assessment: Low
```

#### Intelligent Scaling Strategies

**Use Case**: E-commerce platform with variable traffic

**AI-Driven Solution**:
- Learns traffic patterns from historical data
- Predicts load before it happens
- Pre-scales resources for expected demand
- Reduces response time by 40%

### 3. Automated Deployment Assistance

#### Configuration Validation

**Scenario**: Deploying a new microservice

**AI Agent Actions**:
1. Reviews deployment YAML
2. Identifies missing health checks
3. Suggests resource limits based on similar services
4. Recommends security policies
5. Validates service mesh configuration

**Example Interaction**:
```
User: "Deploy my new payment service"

AI: "I've reviewed your configuration. Here are my recommendations:
- Add liveness probe (suggested config provided)
- Set memory limit to 1Gi based on similar services
- Enable mTLS for service mesh
- Add PodDisruptionBudget for high availability
Would you like me to apply these improvements?"
```

#### Progressive Rollout Management

**Capabilities**:
- Monitors canary deployments
- Analyzes metrics in real-time
- Automatically rolls back on anomalies
- Provides deployment confidence scores

### 4. Cost Optimization

#### Multi-Dimensional Cost Analysis

**Scenario**: Reducing cloud spend without impacting performance

**AI Analysis Provides**:
- Unused resource identification
- Spot instance recommendations
- Reserved instance planning
- Cross-region optimization

**Real Example**:
```
Monthly Savings Identified:
- Idle resources: $1,200
- Right-sizing: $3,500
- Spot instances: $2,100
- Total potential: $6,800 (32% reduction)
```

#### Predictive Budget Management

- Forecasts monthly costs based on trends
- Alerts on unusual spending patterns
- Recommends budget adjustments
- Tracks optimization impact

### 5. Security and Compliance

#### Automated Security Scanning

**Continuous Security Monitoring**:
```
AI Security Agent detects:
- Exposed service without authentication
- Container running as root
- Outdated image with CVEs
- Suspicious network traffic pattern

Immediate notifications with remediation steps
```

#### Compliance Verification

**Use Case**: Healthcare application requiring HIPAA compliance

**AI Actions**:
- Scans all deployments for compliance violations
- Checks encryption at rest and in transit
- Verifies access controls
- Generates compliance reports
- Suggests required changes

### 6. Intelligent Capacity Planning

#### Predictive Scaling

**Scenario**: Preparing for Black Friday traffic

**AI Predictions Based On**:
- Historical traffic patterns
- Current growth trends
- External events calendar
- Resource utilization trends

**Output**:
```
Capacity Requirements for Nov 24:
- Expected traffic: 10x normal
- Required pods: 450 (current: 45)
- Memory needed: 1.8TB
- Recommended pre-scaling: Nov 23, 10 PM
- Confidence: 94%
```

### 7. Developer Productivity

#### Instant Environment Debugging

**Common Developer Question**: "Why is my app not working in staging?"

**AI Investigation**:
1. Compares staging vs development configs
2. Identifies missing environment variable
3. Shows recent changes to staging
4. Provides fix command

**Time Saved**: 30 minutes â†’ 30 seconds

#### Automated Documentation

- Generates API documentation from code
- Creates architecture diagrams
- Documents deployment procedures
- Maintains runbooks automatically
