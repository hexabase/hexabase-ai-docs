# AI-Powered DevOps Use Cases

This guide provides comprehensive scenarios and real-world applications of AI-powered DevOps capabilities within Hexabase.AI, demonstrating how artificial intelligence transforms traditional development and operations workflows.

## Core AI DevOps Scenarios

### 1. Zero-Downtime Deployments

**Challenge**: Deploy critical updates without service interruption

**Traditional Approach Problems**:
- Manual deployment decisions
- Risk of failed rollouts
- Reactive incident response
- Limited rollback capabilities

**AI-Enhanced Solution**:

#### Pre-deployment Analysis
```python
# AI agent for pre-deployment analysis
class PreDeploymentAnalyzer(AIAgent):
    def analyze_deployment(self, deployment_config, historical_data):
        # Analyze code changes for risk factors
        risk_score = self.assess_risk(deployment_config.changes)
        
        # Predict deployment success probability
        success_probability = self.predict_success(
            deployment_config, 
            historical_data
        )
        
        # Recommend deployment strategy
        strategy = self.recommend_strategy(risk_score, success_probability)
        
        return {
            'risk_score': risk_score,
            'success_probability': success_probability,
            'recommended_strategy': strategy,
            'rollback_plan': self.generate_rollback_plan()
        }
```

#### Smart Canary Rollout
- AI monitors canary metrics in real-time
- Dynamically adjusts traffic distribution
- Makes autonomous go/no-go decisions
- Learns from each deployment for future optimization

#### Implementation Example
```yaml
# AI-enhanced deployment configuration
deployment:
  strategy: smart_canary
  ai_config:
    models:
      - deployment_risk_assessment
      - traffic_pattern_analysis
      - performance_prediction
    decision_criteria:
      error_rate_threshold: 0.1%
      latency_increase_threshold: 5%
      success_rate_threshold: 99.9%
    automation_level: full  # supervised, assisted, full
```

**Results**:

        error_patterns = self.analyze_log_patterns(logs)
        trace_issues = self.analyze_distributed_traces(traces)
        
        # Correlate across data sources
        incidents = self.correlate_issues(anomalies, error_patterns, trace_issues)
        
        # Prioritize and classify
        for incident in incidents:
            incident.severity = self.assess_severity(incident)
            incident.category = self.classify_incident(incident)
            incident.affected_services = self.identify_impact(incident)
            
        return incidents
```

#### Intelligent Root Cause Analysis

      - dependency_mapping
      - historical_pattern_matching
      - remediation_planning
    escalation:

        bottlenecks = self.identify_bottlenecks(app_metrics)
        
        # Analyze resource patterns
        resource_patterns = self.analyze_resource_usage(resource_usage)
        
        # Generate optimization recommendations
        optimizations = []
        for bottleneck in bottlenecks:
            optimization = self.generate_optimization(
                bottleneck, 
                resource_patterns
            )
            optimizations.append(optimization)
            
        return optimizations
