# Scale Up: Dedicated Node

## 1. Use Case Name
Scale Up: Dedicated Node

## 2. Actors
- **Primary Actor:** Individual Developer
- **Secondary Actors:** Hexabase.AI System, Kubernetes Cluster, Resource Provisioning Service

## 3. Preconditions
- The developer is using the Pro plan
- The application is ready for production environment
- More performance and resource guarantees are needed
- Migration from shared node pool to dedicated resources is being considered

## 4. Success Scenario (Basic Flow)
1. The developer accesses the "Node Management" section of the dashboard
2. The system displays current resource usage and shared node pool limitations
3. The developer clicks the "Add Dedicated Node" button
4. The system displays the dedicated node configuration wizard
5. The developer selects node size (CPU, memory, storage)
6. The system displays estimated monthly cost and performance improvement description
7. The developer confirms node configuration and clicks the "Start Provisioning" button
8. The system begins provisioning the dedicated node
9. The system displays provisioning progress in real-time
10. The system displays dedicated node ready notification
11. The developer accesses the "Workload Migration" screen
12. The system displays a list of migratable applications and services
13. The developer selects the production deployment
14. The developer clicks the "Migrate to Dedicated Node" button
15. The system performs zero-downtime migration
16. The system confirms migration completion and performance improvement
17. The developer verifies application performance on the new dedicated resources

## 5. Alternative Scenarios (Alternative Flows)
**5a. Dedicated Node Provisioning Failure**
- 8a. A resource constraint error occurs during dedicated node creation
- 8b. The system displays error details and alternative options
- 8c. The system suggests retry in a different region
- 8d. The developer selects alternative configuration and executes provisioning again

**5b. Workload Migration Error**
- 15a. An error occurs during production deployment migration
- 15b. The system automatically performs rollback
- 15c. The system displays error cause and troubleshooting procedures
- 15d. The developer reviews and corrects application configuration
- 15e. The developer executes migration process again

**5c. Resource Shortage Warning**
- 5c1. The selected node size is insufficient for current workload
- 5c2. The system displays recommended size and warning message
- 5c3. The developer selects a larger node size
- 5c4. Or creates a phased migration plan

**5d. Performance Issues During Migration**
- 5d1. Application response time increases during migration
- 5d2. The system detects temporary performance degradation and notifies
- 5d3. The system pauses the migration process
- 5d4. The developer adjusts migration timing and resumes processing

## 6. Postconditions
- A dedicated node is provisioned and available
- Production deployment is migrated to the dedicated node
- Application performance is improved
- Resource isolation is achieved
- Stable performance guarantee through dedicated resources is provided
- Higher performance and resource guarantees are available
- The developer has access to dedicated node monitoring and scaling options
- Complete isolation from the shared node pool is achieved
