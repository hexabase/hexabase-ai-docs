# Upgrade Plan

## 1. Use Case Name
Upgrade Plan

## 2. Actors
- **Primary Actor:** Individual Developer
- **Secondary Actors:** Hexabase.AI System, Payment System, Kubernetes Cluster

## 3. Preconditions
- The developer is using the Hobby plan
- The application is ready for production environment migration
- The developer has payment information (credit card, etc.)
- Existing workloads are running on shared node pool

## 4. Success Scenario (Basic Flow)
1. The developer accesses the "Plan" section of the dashboard
2. The system displays current Hobby plan usage and limitations
3. The developer clicks the "Upgrade to Pro" button
4. The system displays Pro plan feature comparison and pricing information
5. The developer clicks the "Start Upgrade" button
6. The system displays the payment information input screen
7. The developer enters credit card information
8. The system validates the payment information
9. The developer reviews the terms of service and clicks the agreement checkbox
10. The developer clicks the "Execute Upgrade" button
11. The system executes payment processing
12. The system starts the plan upgrade
13. The system begins dedicated node provisioning
14. The system displays upgrade progress
15. The system displays upgrade completion notification
16. The developer verifies enhanced features (unlimited Functions, advanced AIOps)

## 5. Alternative Scenarios (Alternative Flows)
**5a. Payment Failure**
- 11a. Credit card payment fails
- 11b. The system displays payment error message
- 11c. The developer reviews and corrects payment information
- 11d. The developer executes payment processing again

**5b. Dedicated Node Provisioning Failure**
- 13a. A resource shortage error occurs during dedicated node creation
- 13b. The system displays error status on the dashboard
- 13c. The system automatically executes retry
- 13d. If retry fails, the support team manually handles the issue

**5c. Upgrade Interruption**
- 12a. Network connection is lost during upgrade processing
- 12b. The system pauses the upgrade
- 12c. After connection recovery, the system automatically resumes processing
- 12d. The developer re-confirms the progress

**5d. Existing Workload Impact**
- 12a. Existing applications become temporarily inaccessible during upgrade
- 12b. The system executes phased migration to minimize impact
- 12c. The system restores application access after migration completion

## 6. Postconditions
- The account is changed to Pro plan
- A dedicated node is provisioned and available
- Existing workloads continue execution without interruption
- Unlimited Functions and CronJobs are available
- Advanced AIOps features (anomaly detection, predictive scaling) are enabled
- 100GB high-performance SSD storage is available
- Automatic backup is configured
- 99.9% uptime guarantee is applied
- Priority email support is available
