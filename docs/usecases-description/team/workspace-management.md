# Create and Manage Multiple Workspaces

## 1. Use Case Name
Create and Manage Multiple Workspaces

## 2. Actors
- **Primary Actor:** Organization Administrator
- **Secondary Actors:** Hexabase.AI System, Team Members, Kubernetes Cluster

## 3. Preconditions
- Organization and team are already configured
- Organization administrator has organization management permissions
- Environment separation strategy (development, staging) is planned
- Dedicated node resources are available

## 4. Success Scenario (Basic Flow)
1. Organization administrator accesses the "Workspaces" section of the organization dashboard
2. Organization administrator clicks the "Create New Workspace" button
3. The system displays the workspace creation wizard
4. Organization administrator enters workspace name (e.g., `SaaS-Product-Dev`)
5. Organization administrator selects workspace purpose (development environment)
6. Organization administrator sets resource quotas (CPU, memory, storage)
7. Organization administrator clicks the "Create Workspace" button
8. The system creates Kubernetes namespace and applies resource quotas
9. Organization administrator navigates to team member assignment screen
10. Organization administrator selects developers and grants `developer` permissions
11. Organization administrator grants `workspace-admin` permissions to DevOps engineer
12. The system applies permission settings and grants access rights to members
13. Organization administrator creates a second workspace (`SaaS-Product-Staging`) using the same procedure
14. Organization administrator sets higher resource quotas for staging
15. The system confirms completion of both workspace creations
16. Organization administrator navigates to the "Dedicated Node Management" screen
17. Organization administrator provisions dedicated nodes
18. The system creates dedicated nodes and configures them to be shareable between workspaces

## 5. Alternative Scenarios (Alternative Flows)
**5a. Resource Quota Exceeded**
- 6a. Set resource quotas exceed organization's available resources
- 6b. The system displays limit exceeded error message
- 6c. Organization administrator adjusts resource allocation
- 6d. Or reviews existing workspace quotas

**5b. Workspace Name Duplication**
- 4a. Entered workspace name is already in use within the organization
- 4b. The system displays duplication error and alternatives
- 4c. Organization administrator enters a different workspace name

**5c. Dedicated Node Provisioning Failure**
- 17a. Infrastructure error occurs during dedicated node creation
- 17b. The system displays error details and troubleshooting information
- 17c. Organization administrator contacts support or retries later

**5d. Permission Grant Error**
- 11a. Permission grant to team member fails
- 11b. The system displays permission error message
- 11c. Organization administrator checks member's organization affiliation status
- 11d. Organization administrator re-executes permission configuration

## 6. Postconditions
- Development workspace (`SaaS-Product-Dev`) is created
- Staging workspace (`SaaS-Product-Staging`) is created
- Appropriate resource quotas are set for each workspace
- Team members are assigned to each workspace with appropriate permissions
- Dedicated nodes are provisioned and shareable between workspaces
- Environment isolation is achieved
- Each workspace is independently monitored
